## Sutakku
Sutakku is a productivity app for developers working with GitHub to efficiently refactor or plan the project.

### How the idea is formed
Everytime I've learned a new technique, I found my previous project should improved and replaced with more efficient code. But they are quite subtle and I didn't pay that much attention them enough time to refactor. Later I forgot(also bored) and the ideas got wasted. Thus, I got the idea to create a web app that let the user directly login with GitHub and starting taking note to refactor right away without worrying much about credentials.

### how to use
All you need to have is a GitHub account to login and a few repositories.
Sutakku let you create a stack per repository by simply clicking the add button without extra details.
